# Time-Series-Analysis-Project-ML-

Project Overview:
This project focuses on Time Series Analysis using the famous Air Passengers dataset, which tracks the number of airline passengers over a 12-year period (from 1949 to 1960). The goal of the project is to analyze the time-dependent data, build forecasting models, and predict future passenger counts. The analysis includes data cleaning, preprocessing, visualizations, and the application of machine learning algorithms to forecast future trends.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is AirPassengers.csv, containing monthly data on the number of airline passengers (in thousands) from 1949 to 1960. The columns typically include:

Month: The time (from January 1949 to December 1960).
Number of Passengers: The number of airline passengers (in thousands) for each month.
The dataset helps in understanding the seasonal trends and cyclical patterns in passenger numbers.

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:
Handling Missing Data: Missing values in the dataset are identified and dealt with, usually through interpolation or filling with appropriate values.
Date Parsing: The Month column is parsed into a datetime format to ensure proper time series analysis.
Normalization: Depending on the forecasting model, the data may be normalized or scaled to improve prediction accuracy.
Stationarity Check: Time series data is checked for stationarity (constant mean and variance). If needed, transformations like differencing are applied to make the data stationary.

Data Visualization:
Visualizations play a crucial role in understanding time series data. The following visualizations are typically included:

Time Series Plot: A line graph showing the number of passengers over time, revealing trends, seasonality, and patterns.
Rolling Mean/Standard Deviation: Plots the moving average and moving standard deviation to identify trends and stationarity.
Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Plots: These plots are used to identify significant lags and seasonality in the data.

Key Technologies Used:
Python: The programming language used for analysis and model development.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization libraries for creating plots like line charts, histograms, and heatmaps.
Statsmodels: Provides statistical models for time series forecasting, such as ARIMA.
Scikit-Learn: Utilized for machine learning techniques, especially for creating and evaluating predictive models.

Conclusion:
The Air Passengers Time Series Analysis project demonstrates how to analyze and forecast time-dependent data using Python. It focuses on detecting patterns, trends, and seasonality within the dataset and applying machine learning models for prediction. This project helps in understanding the importance of preprocessing and the use of time series forecasting techniques to make future predictions, with applications in real-world scenarios like predicting future airline passenger numbers.
